## Planning and Development Process

I took inspiration from a few cryptocurrency tracking websites and made a wireframe on Figma. The app has to be able to extract latest data from the market. So I chose a reliable CoinGecko API. The app has to be simple enough for user to understand how to use it and display data intuitively.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

I had to break it down into smaller individual components and tackle it one step at a time. I had to rely on console.log() most of
the time to ensure that I am on the right track. My source of knowledge has been supplemented from stackoverflow, mozilla, ChatGPT and YouTube.

### Unsolved problems

Cryptocurrencies: User should be able to all crpytocurrencies.

NFT: Should be able to access more data when clicking on the NFT.

Watchlist: User should be able to add cryptocurrencies and NFTs to favourites.
